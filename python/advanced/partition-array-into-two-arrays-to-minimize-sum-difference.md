### Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize Sum Difference: Step-by-Step Solution

This is a very challenging problem that asks us to partition an array of `2 * n` integers into two arrays of length `n` each, such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimized. The constraint `n <= 15` (meaning `2*n <= 30`) suggests that a solution involving `2^n` or `2^(n/2)` complexity might be acceptable.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

We need to select `n` elements for the first array, and the remaining `n` elements will form the second array. The goal is to make the sums of these two arrays as close as possible.

Let `S` be the total sum of all elements in `nums`. If the sum of the first array is `S1`, then the sum of the second array will be `S - S1`. We want to minimize `|S1 - (S - S1)| = |2 * S1 - S|`.

#### 2. Optimal Approach: Meet-in-the-Middle

Since `2^30` is too large, but `2^15` is manageable, this problem is a classic candidate for the **Meet-in-the-Middle** technique. We split the `2*n` elements into two halves, generate all possible sums for subsets of size `n/2` from each half, and then combine them.

Here's the intuition:
-   Split the `2*n` array `nums` into two halves: `nums_left` (first `n` elements) and `nums_right` (last `n` elements).
-   We need to pick `n` elements in total. Let's say we pick `k` elements from `nums_left` and `n-k` elements from `nums_right`.
-   For each `k` from `0` to `n`, we generate all possible sums of subsets of size `k` from `nums_left` and all possible sums of subsets of size `n-k` from `nums_right`.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Calculate the `total_sum` of all elements in `nums`.
2.  Split `nums` into two halves: `nums_left = nums[:n]` and `nums_right = nums[n:]`.
3.  Create a dictionary (or list of lists) `sums_left` where `sums_left[k]` will store a list of all possible sums of subsets of size `k` from `nums_left`.
4.  Create a dictionary `sums_right` where `sums_right[k]` will store a list of all possible sums of subsets of size `k` from `nums_right`.
5.  **Generate sums for `nums_left`:** Use a recursive helper function (or bit manipulation) to generate all `2^n` subsets of `nums_left`. For each subset, store its sum and size in `sums_left`.
6.  **Generate sums for `nums_right`:** Similarly, generate all `2^n` subsets of `nums_right`. For each subset, store its sum and size in `sums_right`.
7.  Initialize `min_diff = infinity`.
8.  **Combine sums:** Iterate `k` from `0` to `n` (representing the number of elements taken from `nums_left`).
    a. For each `sum_l` in `sums_left[k]`:
        i. We need to find a `sum_r` from `sums_right[n-k]` such that `sum_l + sum_r` is as close as possible to `total_sum / 2`.
        ii. The target sum for the first partition is `target_sum1 = total_sum / 2`. We are looking for `sum_r` such that `sum_l + sum_r` is close to `target_sum1`.
        iii. More precisely, we want `S1 = sum_l + sum_r` to be close to `total_sum / 2`. This means `sum_r` should be close to `total_sum / 2 - sum_l`.
        iv. Sort `sums_right[n-k]` to use binary search (e.g., `bisect_left` in Python) to find the `sum_r` that minimizes `|2 * (sum_l + sum_r) - total_sum|`.
9.  Return `min_diff`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(2^(n/2) * n) due to generating subsets and sorting/binary searching. The space complexity is O(2^(n/2)) for storing the sums.

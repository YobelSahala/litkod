### Jump Game: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks whether it's possible to reach the last index of an array, starting from the first index. Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum jump length from that position.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

We are looking for reachability. If we can reach a certain index, and from that index we can jump to another, then that new index is also reachable. The goal is to see if the last index is reachable.

#### 2. Dynamic Programming Approach

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Let `dp[i]` be a boolean value indicating whether index `i` is reachable.

1.  Create a `dp` array of size `n` (length of `nums`), initialized to `False`.
2.  Set `dp[0] = True` (the first index is always reachable).
3.  Iterate `i` from `0` to `n - 1`:
    a. If `dp[i]` is `True` (meaning index `i` is reachable):
        i. Iterate `j` from `1` to `nums[i]` (representing possible jump lengths).
        ii. If `i + j` is within the array bounds (`< n`), set `dp[i + j] = True`.
4.  After the loops, `dp[n - 1]` will contain the answer.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case (e.g., `[1,1,1,...]`). The space complexity is O(n).

#### 3. Optimal Approach: Greedy

A more efficient approach is to use a greedy algorithm. We want to find the furthest reachable index. If we can reach the furthest index, we can reach any index before it.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Initialize `max_reach = 0`. This variable will store the maximum index we can reach so far.
2.  Iterate `i` from `0` to `n - 1` (where `n` is the length of `nums`).
    a. **Check reachability:** If the current index `i` is greater than `max_reach`, it means we cannot reach this index, and therefore cannot reach the end. Return `False`.
    b. **Update `max_reach`:** Update `max_reach` to be the maximum of its current value and `i + nums[i]` (the furthest we can jump from the current position).
    c. **Check if end is reachable:** If `max_reach` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` (the last index), it means we can reach the end. Return `True`.
3.  If the loop completes, it means we have successfully iterated through all reachable indices and `max_reach` was always sufficient to cover the next step. Return `True`.

This greedy approach has a time complexity of O(n) because we iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1).

### Python Code Solution

```python
# --- Greedy Approach ---
def can_jump(nums):
    """
    Determines if it's possible to reach the last index in Jump Game.

    Args:
      nums: A list of integers representing maximum jump lengths.

    Returns:
      True if the last index is reachable, False otherwise.
    """
    n = len(nums)
    max_reach = 0

    for i in range(n):
        # If current index is beyond max_reach, we can't proceed
        if i > max_reach:
            return False

        # Update the maximum index reachable
        max_reach = max(max_reach, i + nums[i])

        # If we can reach or pass the last index, return True
        if max_reach >= n - 1:
            return True
            
    return True # Should only be reached if n=1 or already true

```

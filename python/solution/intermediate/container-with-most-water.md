### Container With Most Water: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks us to find two lines in a given array of heights that, along with the x-axis, form a container that can hold the most water. The container cannot be slanted.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

The area of a container formed by two lines at indices `i` and `j` (where `i < j`) is given by `min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i)`. We need to maximize this area.

#### 2. Brute-Force Approach

A straightforward approach is to consider every possible pair of lines. We can use two nested loops, one for `i` and one for `j` (where `j > i`), calculate the area for each pair, and keep track of the maximum area found. This would have a time complexity of O(n^2), which is too slow for the given constraints.

#### 3. Optimal Approach: Two Pointers

This problem can be solved efficiently using a two-pointer approach. The intuition is that the area of a container is limited by the shorter of the two lines and the distance between them. To maximize the area, we want to maximize both the height and the width.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Initialize two pointers, `left = 0` and `right = len(height) - 1`.
2.  Initialize `max_area = 0`.
3.  Loop as long as `left < right`:
    a. Calculate the `current_height = min(height[left], height[right])`.
    b. Calculate the `current_width = right - left`.
    c. Calculate the `current_area = current_height * current_width`.
    d. Update `max_area = max(max_area, current_area)`.
    e. **Move the pointers:** This is the crucial step. To potentially find a larger area, we need to try to increase the `current_height`. We move the pointer of the *shorter* line inwards.
        - If `height[left] < height[right]`, increment `left`.
        - Else (if `height[right] <= height[left]`), decrement `right`.
4.  Return `max_area`.

Why does moving the shorter pointer work? If we move the taller pointer, the `current_height` will either stay the same (if the new line is taller than the shorter one) or decrease. However, the `current_width` will always decrease. This means the area will either decrease or stay the same. By moving the shorter pointer, we have a chance to find a taller line that could potentially increase the `current_height`, leading to a larger area.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because the two pointers traverse the array once. The space complexity is O(1).

### Python Code Solution

```python
def max_area(height):
    """
    Finds the maximum amount of water a container can store.

    Args:
      height: A list of integers representing the heights of vertical lines.

    Returns:
      The maximum area of water that can be contained.
    """
    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1
    max_area = 0

    while left < right:
        current_height = min(height[left], height[right])
        current_width = right - left
        current_area = current_height * current_width
        max_area = max(max_area, current_area)

        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
            
    return max_area

```

### Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Step-by-Step Solution

The problem asks for the length of the longest substring in a given string `s` that does not contain any repeating characters.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For example, "abc" is a substring of "abcabcbb", but "abcb" is not because the characters are not contiguous after the first 'b'. The key is to find the longest such substring with no repeated characters.

#### 2. Brute-Force Approach

The most obvious approach is to generate all possible substrings, check each one for repeating characters, and keep track of the maximum length found. This would involve two nested loops to generate the substrings and another loop (or a set) to check for uniqueness, leading to a time complexity of roughly O(n^3) or O(n^2), which is too slow for the given constraints.

#### 3. Optimal Approach: Sliding Window

A much more efficient method is the "sliding window" technique. A sliding window is an abstract concept of a sub-array or sub-string that "slides" over the main array or string. We can maintain a window (represented by two pointers, `left` and `right`) that contains the current substring we are examining.

- We use a `right` pointer to expand the window by moving it to the right, one character at a time.
- We use a `left` pointer to shrink the window from the left if we find a repeating character.
- A hash set (or a dictionary/map) is perfect for keeping track of the characters currently in our window.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Initialize a hash set `char_set` to store unique characters in the current window.
2.  Initialize two pointers, `left = 0` and `right = 0`.
3.  Initialize a variable `max_length = 0`.
4.  Loop with the `right` pointer from the start to the end of the string:
    a. Get the character `char = s[right]`.
    b. **Check for repetition:** While `char` is already in `char_set`, it means we have a repeat. We must shrink the window from the left. Remove `s[left]` from the `char_set` and increment `left`.
    c. **Expand the window:** After ensuring the current character is not a repeat in the window, add `char` to `char_set`.
    d. **Update max length:** The length of the current valid window is `right - left + 1`. Update `max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)`.
    e. Move the right pointer: `right += 1`.
5.  After the loop finishes, `max_length` will hold the answer.

This approach is much more efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) because each character is visited by the `left` and `right` pointers at most once. The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in the string (the size of the character set).

### Python Code Solution

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    """
    Finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

    Args:
      s: The input string.

    Returns:
      The length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
    """
    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    return max_length

```

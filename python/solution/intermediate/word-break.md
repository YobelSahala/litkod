### Word Break: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks whether a given string `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. The same word in the dictionary can be reused.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

This is a classic dynamic programming problem. It can be thought of as: can `s[0...i]` be segmented if `s[0...j]` is a valid word and `s[j+1...i]` can also be segmented? This recursive structure suggests DP.

#### 2. Dynamic Programming Approach

Let `dp[i]` be a boolean value indicating whether the substring `s[0...i-1]` (i.e., the first `i` characters of `s`) can be segmented into dictionary words.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Convert `wordDict` into a `set` for O(1) average time lookups. This is crucial for efficiency.
2.  Create a `dp` array of size `len(s) + 1`. Initialize `dp[0]` to `True` (an empty string can always be segmented).
3.  Iterate `i` from `1` to `len(s)` (representing the end index of the current substring `s[0...i-1]`):
    a. For each `i`, iterate `j` from `0` to `i - 1` (representing a potential split point).
    b. Check two conditions:
        i. Is `dp[j]` `True`? (meaning the prefix `s[0...j-1]` can be segmented).
        ii. Is the substring `s[j...i-1]` (from index `j` up to, but not including, `i`) present in `wordDict`?
    c. If both conditions are `True`, then `s[0...i-1]` can be segmented. Set `dp[i] = True` and `break` from the inner loop (no need to check further `j` for this `i`).
4.  After the loops, `dp[len(s)]` will contain the answer.

This approach has a time complexity of O(N * M * K) where N is `len(s)`, M is `len(wordDict)`, and K is the average length of words in `wordDict`. More precisely, it's O(N^2 * L) where L is the max length of a word in `wordDict` (due to substring creation and dictionary lookup). The space complexity is O(N) for the `dp` array and O(M*K) for the word dictionary set.

### Python Code Solution

```python
def word_break(s, wordDict):
    """
    Determines if a string can be segmented into dictionary words.

    Args:
      s: The input string.
      wordDict: A list of dictionary words.

    Returns:
      True if s can be segmented, False otherwise.
    """
    word_set = set(wordDict)
    n = len(s)
    dp = [False] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = True # Empty string can always be segmented

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            # Check if prefix s[0...j-1] is segmentable (dp[j] is True)
            # AND if the suffix s[j...i-1] is in the word dictionary
            if dp[j] and s[j:i] in word_set:
                dp[i] = True
                break # Once dp[i] is True, no need to check further j's
                
    return dp[n]

```

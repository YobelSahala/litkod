### Group Anagrams: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks us to group words that are anagrams of each other from a given list of strings. Anagrams are words formed by rearranging the letters of another, meaning they contain the same characters with the same frequencies.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

We need to identify a way to uniquely represent an anagram. For example, "eat", "tea", and "ate" are all anagrams of each other. They all contain one 'e', one 'a', and one 't'.

#### 2. Optimal Approach: Using a Hash Map with Sorted Strings as Keys

The most common and efficient approach involves using a hash map (dictionary in Python) where the **key** for each group of anagrams is a canonical representation of the anagram, and the **value** is a list of strings that are anagrams of each other.

What makes a good canonical representation?

- **Sorted String:** If you sort the letters of an anagram, they will all produce the same sorted string. For example, sorting "eat", "tea", and "ate" all result in "aet". This sorted string can serve as our unique key.
- **Character Count Tuple/String:** Another way is to count the frequency of each character (e.g., `(1,0,0,1,1,0...)` for 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', etc.) and use this count as a key. This is particularly useful if the character set is small and fixed (like lowercase English letters).

Here is the algorithm using sorted strings as keys:

1.  Initialize an empty hash map, `anagram_groups`.
2.  Iterate through each `word` in the input list `strs`:
    a. Create a `key` for the current `word` by sorting its characters. For example, if `word` is "tea", the `key` would be "aet".
    b. Check if this `key` already exists in `anagram_groups`:
        - If it does, append the current `word` to the list associated with that `key`.
        - If it does not, create a new entry in `anagram_groups` with the `key` and initialize its value as a new list containing only the current `word`.
3.  After iterating through all words, the `anagram_groups` hash map will contain all the anagrams grouped by their sorted keys. The values of this hash map are the lists of anagrams. Return `anagram_groups.values()`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(N * K log K), where N is the number of strings in the input list, and K is the maximum length of a string. The `K log K` comes from sorting each string. The space complexity is O(N * K) in the worst case, where all strings are unique and stored in the hash map.

### Python Code Solution

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def group_anagrams(strs):
    """
    Groups anagrams together from a list of strings.

    Args:
      strs: A list of strings.

    Returns:
      A list of lists, where each inner list contains a group of anagrams.
    """
    # Use defaultdict to automatically create a list for a new key
    anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)

    for word in strs:
        # Create a sorted tuple of characters as the key
        # e.g., "eat" -> ('a', 'e', 't')
        key = tuple(sorted(word))
        anagram_groups[key].append(word)

    # Return the values (lists of anagrams) from the dictionary
    return list(anagram_groups.values())

# --- Alternative: Character Count Tuple as Key ---
def group_anagrams_char_count(strs):
    anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)

    for word in strs:
        # Create a character count array (tuple for hashability)
        # For lowercase English letters, 26 positions
        count = [0] * 26
        for char in word:
            count[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        # Use the tuple of counts as the key
        key = tuple(count)
        anagram_groups[key].append(word)

    return list(anagram_groups.values())

```

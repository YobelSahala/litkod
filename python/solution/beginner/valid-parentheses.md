### Valid Parentheses: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem requires checking for properly matched and nested brackets. This is a classic use case for the **Stack** data structure.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

The rules for validity are key: brackets must be closed by the same type and in the correct order. This "last in, first out" behavior is a strong hint that a stack is the right tool. The most recently opened bracket must be the first one to be closed.

- `(` must be closed by `)`
- `{` must be closed by `}`
- `[` must be closed by `]`

#### 2. The Stack-Based Approach

We can iterate through the input string and use a stack to keep track of the open brackets we encounter.

- When we see an **opening bracket** (`(`, `{`, `[`), we **push** it onto the stack.
- When we see a **closing bracket** (`)`, `}`, `]`), we need to check if it matches the most recent opening bracket. We do this by looking at the top of the stack.
    - If the stack is empty, it means we have a closing bracket without a corresponding opener, so the string is invalid.
    - If the stack is not empty, we **pop** the top element. If this popped element is the correct opening bracket for our current closing bracket, then everything is fine so far. 
    - If it's not the correct opening bracket, the string is invalid.

After iterating through the entire string, we need to do one final check:

- If the stack is **empty**, it means every opening bracket was successfully matched with a closing bracket. The string is **valid**.
- If the stack is **not empty**, it means there are unclosed opening brackets. The string is **invalid**.

#### 3. The Algorithm

1.  Initialize an empty stack.
2.  Create a hash map to store the matching pairs: `mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}`.
3.  Iterate through each character `char` in the input string `s`:
    a. If `char` is a closing bracket (i.e., it's a key in our `mapping`):
        i. Pop the top element from the stack. If the stack was empty, assign a dummy value (e.g., '#') to the popped element.
        ii. Check if the popped element matches the required opening bracket from our `mapping`. If `mapping[char] != popped_element`, return `False`.
    b. Else (if `char` is an opening bracket):
        i. Push `char` onto the stack.
4.  After the loop, if the stack is empty, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because we iterate through the string once. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case (e.g., a string of all opening brackets).

### Python Code Solution

```python
def is_valid(s):
    """
    Determines if the input string has valid parentheses.

    Args:
      s: The input string.

    Returns:
      True if the string is valid, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []
    mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}

    for char in s:
        if char in mapping: # If it's a closing bracket
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else: # If it's an opening bracket
            stack.append(char)

    return not stack # The stack should be empty for a valid string

```

### Palindrome Linked List: Step-by-Step Solution

A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backward. For a linked list, this means the sequence of values must be palindromic. The challenge is that we can only traverse a singly linked list forwards.

#### 1. Naive Approach: Convert to Array

The simplest way to solve this is to convert the linked list into an array and then check if the array is a palindrome.

1.  Create an empty array `vals`.
2.  Traverse the linked list from the `head` to the end, appending each node's value to the `vals` array.
3.  Once the list is fully stored in the array, use a two-pointer approach (one at the beginning, one at the end) to check if the array is a palindrome. Move the pointers inwards, and if at any point the values don't match, return `false`.
4.  If the pointers meet or cross without finding a mismatch, the list is a palindrome. Return `true`.

This approach is easy to understand but requires O(n) extra space for the array, which might not be optimal for an interview setting.

#### 2. Optimal Approach: Reverse the Second Half

A more advanced and space-efficient solution involves reversing the second half of the linked list and then comparing it with the first half.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  **Find the middle of the linked list:** We can do this using the fast and slow pointer technique (like in the "Linked List Cycle" problem). The `slow` pointer will be at the middle of the list when the `fast` pointer reaches the end.
2.  **Reverse the second half:** Starting from the node *after* the middle (`slow.next`), reverse the rest of the linked list. Let's call the head of this new reversed half `second_half_head`.
3.  **Compare the two halves:**
    a. Initialize two pointers, `first_half_ptr = head` and `second_half_ptr = second_half_head`.
    b. Traverse both halves simultaneously. Compare the values of the nodes pointed to by `first_half_ptr` and `second_half_ptr`.
    c. If at any point the values are not equal, the list is not a palindrome. Return `false`.
4.  If the traversal of the second half completes without any mismatches, the list is a palindrome. Return `true`.
5.  **(Optional but good practice):** Restore the original linked list by reversing the second half again and connecting it back to the first half.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because we traverse the list a constant number of times. The space complexity is O(1) because we are modifying the list in-place.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

def is_palindrome(head):
    """
    Checks if a linked list is a palindrome by reversing the second half.

    Args:
      head: The head of the linked list.

    Returns:
      True if the linked list is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """
    if not head or not head.next:
        return True

    # 1. Find the middle of the list
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

    # 2. Reverse the second half
    prev = None
    current = slow
    while current:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    # `prev` is now the head of the reversed second half

    # 3. Compare the first and reversed second halves
    first_half_ptr, second_half_ptr = head, prev
    while second_half_ptr: # The second half can be shorter in odd-length lists
        if first_half_ptr.val != second_half_ptr.val:
            return False
        first_half_ptr = first_half_ptr.next
        second_half_ptr = second_half_ptr.next
        
    return True

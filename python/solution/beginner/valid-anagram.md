### Valid Anagram: Step-by-Step Solution

An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another. This means that two strings are anagrams if and only if they contain the exact same characters with the exact same frequencies.

#### 1. Sorting Approach

A simple and clever way to check this is to sort both strings. If they are anagrams, their sorted versions will be identical.

1.  First, check if the lengths of the two strings `s` and `t` are different. If they are, they cannot be anagrams, so return `false`.
2.  Convert both strings to character arrays and sort them.
3.  Compare the sorted arrays. If they are identical, the strings are anagrams. Return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

This approach is concise and easy to understand. The time complexity will be dominated by the sorting algorithm, which is typically O(n log n), where n is the length of the strings.

#### 2. Optimal Approach: Frequency Counter (Hash Map)

A more efficient approach, and often the one expected in interviews, is to use a hash map (or a simple array as a frequency counter) to record the character counts for each string.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are different. If so, return `false`.
2.  Create a hash map (or an array of size 26, since the inputs are only lowercase English letters) to store the frequency of each character in string `s`.
3.  Iterate through string `s` and for each character, increment its count in the hash map.
4.  Now, iterate through string `t`. For each character in `t`:
    a. Decrement its count in the hash map.
    b. If a character's count drops below zero at any point, or if a character from `t` is not in the hash map at all, it means `t` has a character that `s` doesn't have, or has more of a certain character. Return `false`.
5.  If the loop completes, it means both strings have the same character frequencies. Return `true`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because we iterate through both strings once. The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of unique characters. Since the problem states the strings consist of lowercase English letters, the space complexity is O(26), which simplifies to O(1) (constant space).

### Remove Invalid Parentheses: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks us to remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses from a given string to make it valid, and return all possible valid results. The string can contain lowercase English letters, `(` and `)`.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

This is a search problem. We are looking for valid strings that can be formed by removing the minimum number of parentheses. This implies a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, where we explore strings by removing one parenthesis at a time, level by level.

#### 2. Optimal Approach: BFS

We can use BFS to explore the state space. Each state is a string. We start with the original string and, at each level, generate all possible strings by removing one parenthesis. We stop when we find the first valid string(s), as these will correspond to the minimum number of removals.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  **Helper Function `is_valid(s)`:** Create a helper function that checks if a given string `s` is a valid parentheses string. This can be done by iterating through the string, maintaining a `balance` counter. Increment for `(` and decrement for `)`. If `balance` ever goes negative, or is not 0 at the end, it's invalid.
2.  Initialize a `queue` with the original string `s`.
3.  Initialize a `visited` set to keep track of strings already processed to avoid redundant computations.
4.  Initialize an empty list `result` to store the valid strings.
5.  Set a `found_valid = False` flag.
6.  **BFS Traversal:** While the `queue` is not empty:
    a. Dequeue a `current_string`.
    b. If `is_valid(current_string)` is `True`:
        i. Add `current_string` to `result`.
        ii. Set `found_valid = True`.
    c. If `found_valid` is `True`, and we are processing strings from the current level, we should not explore further (because we are looking for the *minimum* removals). Continue to the next string in the queue.
    d. If `found_valid` is `False` (meaning we haven't found any valid strings yet at this level or previous levels):
        i. For each character in `current_string`:
            - If the character is `(` or `)`:
                - Create a `next_string` by removing the current character.
                - If `next_string` has not been `visited`:
                    - Add `next_string` to `visited`.
                    - Enqueue `next_string`.
7.  Return `result`.

This approach guarantees finding all valid strings with the minimum number of removals because BFS explores level by level. The first level at which valid strings are found is the level with the minimum removals.

The time complexity is difficult to analyze precisely but is exponential in the number of invalid parentheses. The space complexity is also exponential for the queue and visited set.

### Python Code Solution

```python
from collections import deque

def is_valid_parentheses(s):
    """
    Helper function to check if a string has valid parentheses.
    """
    balance = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    return balance == 0


def remove_invalid_parentheses(s):
    """
    Removes the minimum number of invalid parentheses to make the string valid.

    Args:
      s: The input string.

    Returns:
      A list of all possible valid results.
    """
    queue = deque([s])
    visited = {s}
    result = []
    found_valid = False

    while queue:
        current_string = queue.popleft()

        if is_valid_parentheses(current_string):
            result.append(current_string)
            found_valid = True

        # If we found valid strings at this level, don't explore further levels
        # because we are looking for minimum removals.
        if found_valid:
            continue

        # Generate next level strings by removing one parenthesis
        for i in range(len(current_string)):
            char = current_string[i]
            if char == '(' or char == ')':
                next_string = current_string[:i] + current_string[i+1:]
                if next_string not in visited:
                    visited.add(next_string)
                    queue.append(next_string)
                    
    return result

```

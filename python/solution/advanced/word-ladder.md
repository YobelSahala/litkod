### Word Ladder: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks for the shortest transformation sequence from a `beginWord` to an `endWord` using a given `wordList`. Each adjacent word in the sequence must differ by only one letter.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem as a Graph

This problem can be modeled as finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Each word is a node, and an edge exists between two words if they differ by exactly one letter. Since we need the *shortest* transformation sequence, Breadth-First Search (BFS) is the ideal algorithm.

#### 2. BFS Approach

Here is the algorithm:

1.  **Pre-processing `wordList`:** Convert `wordList` into a `set` for O(1) average time lookups. This is crucial for checking if a transformed word is valid.
2.  **Edge Case:** If `endWord` is not in `wordList`, then no transformation is possible. Return `0`.
3.  **Initialize BFS:**
    - Create a queue and add `(beginWord, 1)` to it (the word and its current level/length).
    - Create a `visited` set and add `beginWord` to it.
4.  **BFS Traversal:** While the queue is not empty:
    a. Dequeue `(current_word, level)`.
    b. If `current_word == endWord`, we have found the shortest path. Return `level`.
    c. **Generate Neighbors:** For each character position in `current_word`:
        i. Iterate through all possible lowercase English letters (`a` to `z`).
        ii. Create a `next_word` by replacing the character at the current position with the new letter.
        iii. If `next_word` is in `wordList` and has not been `visited`:
            - Add `next_word` to `visited`.
            - Enqueue `(next_word, level + 1)`.
5.  If the queue becomes empty and `endWord` was not reached, it means no transformation sequence exists. Return `0`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(L * N * 26) where L is the length of each word, and N is the number of words in `wordList`. The `26` comes from trying all possible character changes. The space complexity is O(N * L) for the queue and visited set.

### Python Code Solution

```python
from collections import deque

def ladder_length(beginWord, endWord, wordList):
    """
    Finds the length of the shortest transformation sequence.

    Args:
      beginWord: The starting word.
      endWord: The target word.
      wordList: A list of valid words.

    Returns:
      The number of words in the shortest transformation sequence, or 0 if none exists.
    """
    word_set = set(wordList)
    if endWord not in word_set:
        return 0

    queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)]) # (word, level)
    visited = {beginWord}

    while queue:
        current_word, level = queue.popleft()

        if current_word == endWord:
            return level

        # Generate all possible next words
        for i in range(len(current_word)):
            original_char = current_word[i]
            for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                new_char = chr(char_code)
                if new_char == original_char:
                    continue
                
                next_word_list = list(current_word)
                next_word_list[i] = new_char
                next_word = "".join(next_word_list)

                if next_word in word_set and next_word not in visited:
                    visited.add(next_word)
                    queue.append((next_word, level + 1))

    return 0 # No transformation sequence found

```

### Longest Valid Parentheses: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks us to find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring within a string containing only `(` and `)` characters.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

A valid parentheses substring means that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis, and they are properly nested. For example, `"()()"` is valid, `"(()"` has a valid substring `"()"`, and `"())"` has a valid substring `"()"`.

#### 2. Dynamic Programming Approach

Let `dp[i]` be the length of the longest valid parentheses substring ending at index `i`.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Create a `dp` array of size `len(s)`, initialized with zeros.
2.  Initialize `max_len = 0`.
3.  Iterate `i` from `1` to `len(s) - 1`:
    a. If `s[i]` is `')'`:
        i. **Case 1: `s[i-1]` is `'('` (e.g., `...()`)**
            - The current `()` pair contributes 2 to the length.
            - If `i >= 2`, we can add the length of the valid substring ending at `i-2`: `dp[i] = dp[i-2] + 2`.
            - Else (`i = 1`), `dp[i] = 2`.
        ii. **Case 2: `s[i-1]` is `')'` (e.g., `...))`)**
            - We need to find the matching opening parenthesis for `s[i]`. This would be at `i - dp[i-1] - 1`.
            - If `i - dp[i-1] - 1 >= 0` and `s[i - dp[i-1] - 1]` is `'('`:
                - The length of the current valid substring is `dp[i-1] + 2` (for the current `()` pair).
                - If `i - dp[i-1] - 2 >= 0`, we can add the length of the valid substring ending before the matching `(`: `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 + dp[i - dp[i-1] - 2]`.
                - Else, `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2`.
    b. Update `max_len = max(max_len, dp[i])`.
4.  Return `max_len`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).

#### 3. Stack Approach

This is a very common and intuitive way to solve parentheses problems. We use a stack to keep track of the indices of opening parentheses.

1.  Initialize an empty stack and push `-1` onto it. This acts as a base for calculating lengths.
2.  Initialize `max_len = 0`.
3.  Iterate `i` from `0` to `len(s) - 1`:
    a. If `s[i]` is `'('`:
        - Push `i` onto the stack.
    b. If `s[i]` is `')'`:
        - Pop an element from the stack.
        - If the stack becomes empty after popping, it means the current `')'` does not have a matching `(` to its left within the current valid sequence. Push `i` onto the stack as the new base.
        - Else, calculate the length of the current valid substring: `current_len = i - stack[-1]`. Update `max_len = max(max_len, current_len)`.
4.  Return `max_len`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).

### Python Code Solution

```python
# --- Stack Approach ---
def longest_valid_parentheses(s):
    """
    Finds the length of the longest valid parentheses substring using a stack.

    Args:
      s: The input string.

    Returns:

    """
    stack = [-1] # Initialize with -1 as a base for length calculation
    max_len = 0

    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            stack.append(i)
        else: # s[i] == ')'
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                # If stack is empty, this ')' doesn't have a matching '('
                # Push current index as the new base for future calculations
                stack.append(i)
            else:
                # Calculate current valid length
                max_len = max(max_len, i - stack[-1])
                
    return max_len

# --- Dynamic Programming Approach ---
def longest_valid_parentheses_dp(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * n # dp[i] is the length of the longest valid parentheses substring ending at i
    max_len = 0

    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] == ')':
            if s[i-1] == '(': # Case: ...()
                dp[i] = (dp[i-2] if i >= 2 else 0) + 2
            elif i - dp[i-1] > 0 and s[i - dp[i-1] - 1] == '(': # Case: ...))
                dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 + (dp[i - dp[i-1] - 2] if i - dp[i-1] - 2 >= 0 else 0)
        max_len = max(max_len, dp[i])
        
    return max_len

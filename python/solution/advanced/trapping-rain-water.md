### Trapping Rain Water: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks us to calculate the total amount of water that can be trapped between vertical bars of varying heights, given an elevation map. The width of each bar is 1.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

Water can be trapped at a certain position `i` if there are bars to its left and right that are taller than `height[i]`. The amount of water trapped at `i` is determined by the minimum of the maximum height to its left and the maximum height to its right, minus its own height.

`water_at_i = min(max_left_height, max_right_height) - height[i]`

If `water_at_i` is negative, it means no water is trapped at that position.

#### 2. Brute-Force Approach

For each bar `i`, we can find the maximum height to its left and the maximum height to its right by iterating through the array. Then, we calculate the trapped water at `i` and sum it up. This would involve nested loops, leading to an O(n^2) time complexity, which is too slow for the given constraints.

#### 3. Dynamic Programming Approach

We can optimize the calculation of `max_left_height` and `max_right_height` by pre-computing them using dynamic programming.

1.  Create two arrays, `left_max` and `right_max`, both of size `n`.
2.  **Populate `left_max`:** Iterate from left to right. `left_max[i]` will store the maximum height encountered from index `0` to `i`.
    - `left_max[0] = height[0]`
    - `left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], height[i])` for `i > 0`.
3.  **Populate `right_max`:** Iterate from right to left. `right_max[i]` will store the maximum height encountered from index `n-1` to `i`.
    - `right_max[n-1] = height[n-1]`
    - `right_max[i] = max(right_max[i+1], height[i])` for `i < n-1`.
4.  **Calculate trapped water:** Iterate from `i = 0` to `n - 1`. For each `i`, calculate `trapped_water = min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i]`. If `trapped_water` is positive, add it to a `total_water` sum.
5.  Return `total_water`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) (three passes) and a space complexity of O(n) for the `left_max` and `right_max` arrays.

#### 4. Optimal Approach: Two Pointers

This is the most efficient solution, achieving O(n) time complexity with O(1) space complexity. It uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, starting from the ends of the array.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Initialize `left = 0`, `right = n - 1`.
2.  Initialize `left_max = 0`, `right_max = 0`.
3.  Initialize `total_water = 0`.
4.  Loop as long as `left < right`:
    a. **Compare `height[left]` and `height[right]`:**
        i. If `height[left] < height[right]`:
            - If `height[left] >= left_max`, update `left_max = height[left]` (this bar becomes the new left boundary).
            - Else, `total_water += left_max - height[left]` (water trapped at current `left` position).
            - Increment `left`.
        ii. Else (`height[right] <= height[left]`):
            - If `height[right] >= right_max`, update `right_max = height[right]` (this bar becomes the new right boundary).
            - Else, `total_water += right_max - height[right]` (water trapped at current `right` position).
            - Decrement `right`.
5.  Return `total_water`.

The intuition here is that if `height[left] < height[right]`, the amount of water trapped at `left` is determined solely by `left_max` (because `right_max` will always be at least `height[right]`, which is greater than `height[left]`). So, we can confidently calculate water at `left` and move `left`. The symmetric logic applies when `height[right] <= height[left]`.

### Python Code Solution

```python
# --- Two Pointers Approach ---
def trap(height):
    """
    Computes how much water can be trapped after raining.

    Args:
      height: A list of non-negative integers representing an elevation map.

    Returns:
      The total amount of trapped water.
    """
    if not height:
        return 0

    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1
    left_max = 0
    right_max = 0
    total_water = 0

    while left < right:
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            if height[left] >= left_max:
                left_max = height[left]
            else:
                total_water += left_max - height[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            if height[right] >= right_max:
                right_max = height[right]
            else:
                total_water += right_max - height[right]
            right -= 1
            
    return total_water

```

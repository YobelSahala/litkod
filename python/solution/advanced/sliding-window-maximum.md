### Sliding Window Maximum: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks us to find the maximum element in a sliding window of size `k` as it moves across an array `nums`. We need to return an array containing the maximum for each window.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

For `nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3`:
- Window `[1,3,-1]`, max is `3`
- Window `[3,-1,-3]`, max is `3`
- Window `[-1,-3,5]`, max is `5`
...and so on.

A naive approach would be to iterate through each window and find the maximum, which would be O(N*K) and too slow for large N.

#### 2. Optimal Approach: Deque (Double-Ended Queue)

The most efficient solution uses a **deque (double-ended queue)** to store indices of elements in the current window. The deque will maintain elements in **decreasing order** of their values. This way, the maximum element for the current window will always be at the front of the deque.

Here's the intuition:
- When we add a new element to the window, we remove all smaller elements from the back of the deque because they can never be the maximum (they are smaller and appear earlier).
- When the window slides, we remove elements from the front of the deque if their index falls outside the current window.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Initialize an empty deque `dq`.
2.  Initialize an empty list `result` to store the maximums.
3.  Iterate `i` from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`:
    a. **Remove elements out of window:** If the deque is not empty and its front element's index (`dq[0]`) is less than `i - k + 1` (meaning it's outside the current window), remove it from the front: `dq.popleft()`.
    b. **Maintain decreasing order:** While the deque is not empty and `nums[i]` is greater than or equal to `nums[dq[-1]]` (the element at the back of the deque), remove elements from the back: `dq.pop()`.
    c. **Add current element:** Add the current index `i` to the back of the deque: `dq.append(i)`.
    d. **Record maximum:** If `i` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` (meaning the window is fully formed), the maximum for the current window is `nums[dq[0]]` (the element at the front of the deque). Add this to `result`.
4.  Return `result`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because each element is added to and removed from the deque at most once. The space complexity is O(k) for the deque.

### Python Code Solution

```python
from collections import deque

def max_sliding_window(nums, k):
    """
    Finds the maximum in each sliding window of size k.

    Args:
      nums: A list of integers.
      k: The size of the sliding window.

    Returns:
      A list of maximums for each window.
    """
    if not nums or k == 0:
        return []

    dq = deque() # Stores indices
    result = []

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # 1. Remove elements out of window
        if dq and dq[0] < i - k + 1:
            dq.popleft()

        # 2. Maintain decreasing order (remove smaller elements from back)
        while dq and nums[i] >= nums[dq[-1]]:
            dq.pop()

        # 3. Add current element's index to back
        dq.append(i)

        # 4. Record maximum once window is fully formed
        if i >= k - 1:
            result.append(nums[dq[0]])
            
    return result

```

# LeetCode Practice Workspace

This repository is a sandbox and workspace for practicing LeetCode problems, with a focus on questions that are frequently asked in real job interviews.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to provide a structured environment for practicing LeetCode problems to prepare for technical interviews. It includes problems categorized by difficulty, along with detailed solutions.

## Structure

The repository is organized by programming language, with dedicated folders for both **Python** and **JavaScript**.

Within each language folder, the structure is as follows:

- **Problem Descriptions:** Problems are divided into three categories based on difficulty:
  - `beginner/`
  - `intermediate/`
  - `advanced/`

- **Solutions:** Each problem has a corresponding solution file located in the `solution/` directory, which is also categorized by difficulty:
  - `solution/beginner/`
  - `solution/intermediate/`
  - `solution/advanced/`

## Content

For each of the 20 problems in each category, the following files are provided:

1.  **Problem Description:** A Markdown file (`.md`) in the corresponding difficulty folder (e.g., `beginner/`) that contains the problem statement from LeetCode.
2.  **Solution File:** A Markdown file (`.md`) in the corresponding `solution` folder (e.g., `solution/beginner/`) that includes:
    - A step-by-step explanation of the logic and the optimal approach to solving the problem.
    - The full code solution in the respective language (Python or JavaScript).

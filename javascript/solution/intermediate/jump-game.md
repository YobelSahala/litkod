### Jump Game: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks whether it's possible to reach the last index of an array, starting from the first index. Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum jump length at that position.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

We are looking for reachability. If we can reach a certain index, and from that index we can jump to another, then that new index is also reachable. The goal is to see if the last index is reachable.

#### 2. Dynamic Programming Approach

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Let `dp[i]` be a boolean value indicating whether index `i` is reachable.

1.  Create a `dp` array of size `n` (length of `nums`), initialized to `false`.
2.  Set `dp[0] = true` (the first index is always reachable).
3.  Iterate `i` from `0` to `n - 1`:
    a. If `dp[i]` is `true` (meaning index `i` is reachable):
        i. Iterate `j` from `1` to `nums[i]` (representing possible jump lengths).
        ii. If `i + j` is within the array bounds (`< n`), set `dp[i + j] = true`.
4.  After the loops, `dp[n - 1]` will contain the answer.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case (e.g., `[1,1,1,...]`). The space complexity is O(n).

#### 3. Optimal Approach: Greedy

A more efficient approach is to use a greedy algorithm. We want to find the furthest reachable index. If we can reach the furthest index, we can reach any index before it.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Initialize `maxReach = 0`. This variable will store the maximum index we can reach so far.
2.  Iterate `i` from `0` to `n - 1` (where `n` is the length of `nums`).
    a. **Check reachability:** If the current index `i` is greater than `maxReach`, it means we cannot reach this index, and therefore cannot reach the end. Return `false`.
    b. **Update `maxReach`:** Update `maxReach` to be the maximum of its current value and `i + nums[i]` (the furthest we can jump from the current position).
    c. **Check if end is reachable:** If `maxReach` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` (the last index), it means we can reach the end. Return `true`.
3.  If the loop completes, it means we have successfully iterated through all reachable indices and `maxReach` was always sufficient to cover the next step. Return `true`.

This greedy approach has a time complexity of O(n) because we iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1).

### JavaScript Code Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canJump = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let maxReach = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // If current index is beyond maxReach, we can't proceed
        if (i > maxReach) {
            return false;
        }

        // Update the maximum index reachable
        maxReach = Math.max(maxReach, i + nums[i]);

        // If we can reach or pass the last index, return true
        if (maxReach >= n - 1) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return true; // Should only be reached if n=1 or already true
};
```

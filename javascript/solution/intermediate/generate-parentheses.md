### Generate Parentheses: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks us to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses given `n` pairs. A well-formed parenthesis string means that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis, and they are properly nested.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

For `n=1`, the only valid combination is `()`.
For `n=2`, valid combinations are `(())` and `()()`.
For `n=3`, valid combinations are `((()))`, `(()())`, `(())()`, `()(())`, `()()()`.

This problem is a classic example of **backtracking**.

#### 2. Backtracking Approach

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem, and then trying another piece.

For this problem, we can build the parenthesis string character by character. At each step, we decide whether to add an opening parenthesis or a closing parenthesis.

We need to maintain two counts:
- `openCount`: The number of opening parentheses already placed.
- `closeCount`: The number of closing parentheses already placed.

We also need to ensure the string remains well-formed at each step and that we don't exceed `n` for either type of parenthesis.

Here are the rules for adding parentheses:

1.  **Add '(':** We can add an opening parenthesis if `openCount < n`.
2.  **Add ')':** We can add a closing parenthesis if `closeCount < openCount`. This ensures that we never close a parenthesis before an opening one is available.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Initialize an empty array `result` to store the valid combinations.
2.  Define a recursive backtracking function, say `backtrack(currentString, openCount, closeCount)`.
3.  **Base Case:** If `currentString.length === 2 * n`, it means we have built a complete string. If it's well-formed (which our rules ensure), add `currentString` to `result` and return.
4.  **Recursive Steps:**
    a. **Try adding '(':** If `openCount < n`:
        - Call `backtrack(currentString + '(', openCount + 1, closeCount)`.
    b. **Try adding ')':** If `closeCount < openCount`:
        - Call `backtrack(currentString + ')', openCount, closeCount + 1)`.
5.  Initial call: `backtrack("", 0, 0)`.

This approach explores all valid paths to build the strings. The time complexity is a bit complex to derive precisely but is roughly O(4^n / sqrt(n)), related to the nth Catalan number. The space complexity is O(n) for the recursion stack.

### JavaScript Code Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var generateParenthesis = function(n) {
    const result = [];

    function backtrack(currentString, openCount, closeCount) {
        // Base case: if the string is complete
        if (currentString.length === 2 * n) {
            result.push(currentString);
            return;
        }

        // Option 1: Add an opening parenthesis
        if (openCount < n) {
            backtrack(currentString + '(', openCount + 1, closeCount);
        }

        // Option 2: Add a closing parenthesis
        // Only if we have more open parentheses than closed ones
        if (closeCount < openCount) {
            backtrack(currentString + ')', openCount, closeCount + 1);
        }
    }

    backtrack("", 0, 0);
    return result;
};
```

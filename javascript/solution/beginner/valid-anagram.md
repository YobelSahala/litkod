### Valid Anagram: Step-by-Step Solution

An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another. This means that two strings are anagrams if and only if they contain the exact same characters with the exact same frequencies.

#### 1. Sorting Approach

A simple and clever way to check this is to sort both strings. If they are anagrams, their sorted versions will be identical.

1.  First, check if the lengths of the two strings `s` and `t` are different. If they are, they cannot be anagrams, so return `false`.
2.  Convert both strings to character arrays, sort them, and then join them back into strings.
3.  Compare the sorted strings. If they are identical, the strings are anagrams. Return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

This approach is concise and easy to understand. The time complexity will be dominated by the sorting algorithm, which is typically O(n log n), where n is the length of the strings.

#### 2. Optimal Approach: Frequency Counter (Hash Map)

A more efficient approach, and often the one expected in interviews, is to use a hash map (`Map` or a plain `Object`) to record the character counts for each string.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are different. If so, return `false`.
2.  Create a hash map to store the frequency of each character in string `s`.
3.  Iterate through string `s` and for each character, increment its count in the hash map.
4.  Now, iterate through string `t`. For each character in `t`:
    a. Decrement its count in the hash map.
    b. If a character from `t` is not in the map or its count becomes negative, it means the character balance is off. Return `false`.
5.  After the second loop, you could check if all values in the map are zero, but the initial length check and the decrementing process already guarantee this. If the loop completes, the strings are anagrams. Return `true`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because we iterate through both strings once. The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of unique characters. Since the problem states the strings consist of lowercase English letters, the space complexity is O(26), which simplifies to O(1) (constant space).

### JavaScript Code Solution

```javascript
// --- Sorting Approach ---
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isAnagramSorting = function(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) {
        return false;
    }
    // Split into array, sort, and join back to string for comparison
    const sortedS = s.split('').sort().join('');
    const sortedT = t.split('').sort().join('');
    return sortedS === sortedT;
};

// --- Frequency Counter Approach ---
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isAnagramCounter = function(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) {
        return false;
    }

    const charCounts = {};

    // Count characters in s
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const char = s[i];
        charCounts[char] = (charCounts[char] || 0) + 1;
    }

    // Decrement counts for characters in t
    for (let i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
        const char = t[i];
        // If a character in t doesn't exist in s or its count is already zero
        if (!charCounts[char]) {
            return false;
        }
        charCounts[char]--;
    }

    return true;
};
```

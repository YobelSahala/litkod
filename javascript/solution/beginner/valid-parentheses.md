### Valid Parentheses: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem requires checking for properly matched and nested brackets. This is a classic use case for the **Stack** data structure.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

The rules for validity are key: brackets must be closed by the same type and in the correct order. This "last in, first out" behavior is a strong hint that a stack is the right tool. The most recently opened bracket must be the first one to be closed.

- `(` must be closed by `)`
- `{` must be closed by `}`
- `[` must be closed by `]`

#### 2. The Stack-Based Approach

We can iterate through the input string and use a stack (which can be implemented with a simple JavaScript array) to keep track of the open brackets we encounter.

- When we see an **opening bracket** (`(`, `{`, `[`), we **push** it onto the stack.
- When we see a **closing bracket** (`)`, `}`, `]`), we need to check if it matches the most recent opening bracket. We do this by looking at the top of the stack.
    - If the stack is empty, it means we have a closing bracket without a corresponding opener, so the string is invalid.
    - If the stack is not empty, we **pop** the top element. If this popped element is the correct opening bracket for our current closing bracket, then everything is fine so far. 
    - If it's not the correct opening bracket, the string is invalid.

After iterating through the entire string, we need to do one final check:

- If the stack is **empty**, it means every opening bracket was successfully matched with a closing bracket. The string is **valid**.
- If the stack is **not empty**, it means there are unclosed opening brackets. The string is **invalid**.

#### 3. The Algorithm

1.  Initialize an empty stack (array).
2.  Create a hash map to store the matching pairs: `const mapping = { ')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '[' };`.
3.  Iterate through each character `char` in the input string `s`:
    a. If `char` is an opening bracket (i.e., it is a value in our `mapping`), push it onto the stack.
    b. Else (if `char` is a closing bracket):
        i. If the stack is empty, return `false`.
        ii. Pop the top element from the stack.
        iii. Check if the popped element matches the required opening bracket from our `mapping`. If `mapping[char] !== poppedElement`, return `false`.
4.  After the loop, if the stack is empty, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because we iterate through the string once. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case (e.g., a string of all opening brackets).

### JavaScript Code Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isValid = function(s) {
    const stack = [];
    const mapping = { ')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '[' };

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const char = s[i];
        if (mapping[char]) { // If it's a closing bracket
            const topElement = stack.length === 0 ? '#' : stack.pop();
            if (topElement !== mapping[char]) {
                return false;
            }
        } else { // If it's an opening bracket
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }

    return stack.length === 0; // The stack should be empty for a valid string
};
```

### Palindrome Linked List: Step-by-Step Solution

A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backward. For a linked list, this means the sequence of values must be palindromic. The challenge is that we can only traverse a singly linked list forwards.

#### 1. Naive Approach: Convert to Array

The simplest way to solve this is to convert the linked list into an array and then check if the array is a palindrome.

1.  Create an empty array `vals`.
2.  Traverse the linked list from the `head` to the end, pushing each node's value into the `vals` array.
3.  Once the list is fully stored in the array, use a two-pointer approach (one at the beginning, one at the end) to check if the array is a palindrome. Move the pointers inwards, and if at any point the values don't match, return `false`.
4.  If the pointers meet or cross without finding a mismatch, the list is a palindrome. Return `true`.

This approach is easy to understand but requires O(n) extra space for the array, which might not be optimal for an interview setting.

#### 2. Optimal Approach: Reverse the Second Half

A more advanced and space-efficient solution involves reversing the second half of the linked list and then comparing it with the first half.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  **Find the middle of the linked list:** We can do this using the fast and slow pointer technique (like in the "Linked List Cycle" problem). The `slow` pointer will be at the middle of the list when the `fast` pointer reaches the end.
2.  **Reverse the second half:** Starting from the node *after* the middle (`slow.next`), reverse the rest of the linked list. Let's call the head of this new reversed half `secondHalfHead`.
3.  **Compare the two halves:**
    a. Initialize two pointers, `firstHalfPtr = head` and `secondHalfPtr = secondHalfHead`.
    b. Traverse both halves simultaneously. Compare the values of the nodes pointed to by `firstHalfPtr` and `secondHalfPtr`.
    c. If at any point the values are not equal, the list is not a palindrome. Return `false`.
4.  If the traversal of the second half completes without any mismatches, the list is a palindrome. Return `true`.
5.  **(Optional but good practice):** Restore the original linked list by reversing the second half again and connecting it back to the first half.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because we traverse the list a constant number of times. The space complexity is O(1) because we are modifying the list in-place.

### JavaScript Code Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPalindrome = function(head) {
    if (head === null || head.next === null) {
        return true;
    }

    // 1. Find the middle of the list
    let slow = head;
    let fast = head;
    while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }

    // 2. Reverse the second half
    let prev = null;
    let current = slow;
    while (current !== null) {
        const nextNode = current.next;
        current.next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = nextNode;
    }
    // `prev` is now the head of the reversed second half

    // 3. Compare the first and reversed second halves
    let firstHalfPtr = head;
    let secondHalfPtr = prev;
    while (secondHalfPtr !== null) {
        if (firstHalfPtr.val !== secondHalfPtr.val) {
            return false;
        }
        firstHalfPtr = firstHalfPtr.next;
        secondHalfPtr = secondHalfPtr.next;
    }

    return true;
};
```

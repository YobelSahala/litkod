### Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks us to find the length of the longest increasing path in a given `m x n` integer `matrix`. We can move in four directions (left, right, up, down) but not diagonally or outside the boundary.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

An increasing path means that each subsequent cell in the path must have a strictly greater value than the current cell. We are looking for the maximum length of such a path.

#### 2. Optimal Approach: DFS with Memoization

This problem has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, making it a perfect candidate for dynamic programming with memoization. We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore paths from each cell, and memoize the results to avoid redundant calculations.

Let `memo[r][c]` store the length of the longest increasing path starting from cell `(r, c)`.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  Get the dimensions of the matrix: `rows`, `cols`.
2.  Create a `memo` table of the same dimensions, initialized with zeros. This table will store the computed LIS lengths for each cell.
3.  Initialize `maxPath = 0`.
4.  Define a recursive DFS function, `dfs(r, c)`:
    a. **Memoization Check:** If `memo[r][c]` is not 0, it means we have already computed the LIS from this cell. Return `memo[r][c]`.
    b. **Initialize current path length:** `currentPathLength = 1` (the cell itself contributes 1 to the path).
    c. **Explore Neighbors:** For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right):
        i. Calculate the coordinates of the `neighborR, neighborC`.
        ii. **Validity Check:** If the neighbor is within bounds and `matrix[neighborR][neighborC] > matrix[r][c]` (strictly increasing condition):
            -   Recursively call `dfs(neighborR, neighborC)` to get the LIS length starting from the neighbor.
            -   Update `currentPathLength = Math.max(currentPathLength, 1 + dfs(neighborR, neighborC))`.
    d. **Memoize Result:** Store the computed `currentPathLength` in `memo[r][c]`.
    e. Return `memo[r][c]`.
5.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` in the `matrix`:
    a. Call `dfs(r, c)`.
    b. Update `maxPath = Math.max(maxPath, dfs(r, c))`.
6.  Return `maxPath`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(rows * cols) because each cell is visited and computed once. The space complexity is O(rows * cols) for the `memo` table and the recursion stack.

### JavaScript Code Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestIncreasingPath = function(matrix) {
    if (!matrix || matrix.length === 0 || matrix[0].length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    const rows = matrix.length;
    const cols = matrix[0].length;
    const memo = Array(rows).fill(0).map(() => Array(cols).fill(0));
    let maxPath = 0;

    // Define possible moves (down, up, right, left)
    const directions = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]];

    function dfs(r, c) {
        // If already computed, return memoized value
        if (memo[r][c] !== 0) {
            return memo[r][c];
        }

        // Current cell itself contributes 1 to the path
        let currentMaxLen = 1;

        // Explore neighbors
        for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
            const nr = r + dr;
            const nc = c + dc;

            // Check bounds and strictly increasing condition
            if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && matrix[nr][nc] > matrix[r][c]) {
                currentMaxLen = Math.max(currentMaxLen, 1 + dfs(nr, nc));
            }
        }

        // Memoize the result
        memo[r][c] = currentMaxLen;
        return currentMaxLen;
    }

    // Iterate through each cell and start DFS from it
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            maxPath = Math.max(maxPath, dfs(r, c));
        }
    }

    return maxPath;
};

### Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks us to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes `p` and `q` in a binary tree. The LCA is the lowest node in the tree that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (a node can be a descendant of itself).

#### 1. Understanding the Problem

Consider the paths from the root to `p` and `q`. The LCA is the node where these two paths diverge. If one node is an ancestor of the other, then the ancestor itself is the LCA.

#### 2. Optimal Approach: Recursive Traversal

This problem is best solved using a recursive approach. The idea is to traverse the tree and, for each node, determine if `p` or `q` (or both) are present in its left or right subtrees.

Here is the algorithm:

1.  **Base Cases:**
    -   If the `root` is `null`, return `null` (no `p` or `q` found).
    -   If the `root` is `p` or `q`, then the current `root` is the LCA (since a node can be a descendant of itself). Return `root`.
2.  **Recursive Step:**
    a. Recursively call `lowestCommonAncestor` on the left child: `leftLCA = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)`.
    b. Recursively call `lowestCommonAncestor` on the right child: `rightLCA = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)`.
3.  **Process Results:**
    -   If both `leftLCA` and `rightLCA` are not `null`, it means `p` and `q` were found in different subtrees of the current `root`. Therefore, the current `root` is the LCA. Return `root`.
    -   If only `leftLCA` is not `null`, it means both `p` and `q` (or one of them is `leftLCA` itself) are in the left subtree. Return `leftLCA`.
    -   If only `rightLCA` is not `null`, it means both `p` and `q` (or one of them is `rightLCA` itself) are in the right subtree. Return `rightLCA`.
    -   If both are `null`, neither `p` nor `q` were found in the subtrees. Return `null`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because, in the worst case, we might visit all nodes. The space complexity is O(h) due to the recursion stack, where h is the height of the tree.

### JavaScript Code Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 *
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {TreeNode} p
 * @param {TreeNode} q
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var lowestCommonAncestor = function(root, p, q) {
    // Base cases
    if (root === null || root === p || root === q) {
        return root;
    }

    // Recursively search in left and right subtrees
    const leftLCA = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    const rightLCA = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

    // If both leftLCA and rightLCA are not null, it means p and q are in different subtrees
    // So, the current root is the LCA
    if (leftLCA !== null && rightLCA !== null) {
        return root;
    }
    // If only leftLCA is not null, both p and q are in the left subtree
    else if (leftLCA !== null) {
        return leftLCA;
    }
    // If only rightLCA is not null, both p and q are in the right subtree
    else {
        return rightLCA;
    }
};
```

### Word Ladder: Step-by-Step Solution

This problem asks for the shortest transformation sequence from a `beginWord` to an `endWord` using a given `wordList`. Each adjacent word in the sequence must differ by only one letter.

#### 1. Understanding the Problem as a Graph

This problem can be modeled as finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Each word is a node, and an edge exists between two words if they differ by exactly one letter. Since we need the *shortest* transformation sequence, Breadth-First Search (BFS) is the ideal algorithm.

#### 2. BFS Approach

Here is the algorithm:

1.  **Pre-processing `wordList`:** Convert `wordList` into a `Set` for O(1) average time lookups. This is crucial for checking if a transformed word is valid.
2.  **Edge Case:** If `endWord` is not in `wordList`, then no transformation is possible. Return `0`.
3.  **Initialize BFS:**
    -   Create a queue and add `[beginWord, 1]` to it (the word and its current level/length).
    -   Create a `visited` `Set` and add `beginWord` to it.
4.  **BFS Traversal:** While the queue is not empty:
    a. Dequeue `[currentWord, level]`.
    b. If `currentWord === endWord`, we have found the shortest path. Return `level`.
    c. **Generate Neighbors:** For each character position in `currentWord`:
        i. Iterate through all possible lowercase English letters (`a` to `z`).
        ii. Create a `nextWord` by replacing the character at the current position with the new letter.
        iii. If `nextWord` is in `wordList` and has not been `visited`:
            -   Add `nextWord` to `visited`.
            -   Enqueue `[nextWord, level + 1]`.
5.  If the queue becomes empty and `endWord` was not reached, it means no transformation sequence exists. Return `0`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(L * N * 26) where L is the length of each word, and N is the number of words in `wordList`. The `26` comes from trying all possible character changes. The space complexity is O(N * L) for the queue and visited set.

### JavaScript Code Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} beginWord
 * @param {string} endWord
 * @param {string[]} wordList
 * @return {number}
 */
var ladderLength = function(beginWord, endWord, wordList) {
    const wordSet = new Set(wordList);
    if (!wordSet.has(endWord)) {
        return 0;
    }

    const queue = [[beginWord, 1]]; // [word, level]
    const visited = new Set();
    visited.add(beginWord);

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [currentWord, level] = queue.shift();

        if (currentWord === endWord) {
            return level;
        }

        // Generate all possible next words
        for (let i = 0; i < currentWord.length; i++) {
            const originalChar = currentWord[i];
            for (let charCode = 97; charCode <= 122; charCode++) { // ASCII for 'a' to 'z'
                const newChar = String.fromCharCode(charCode);
                if (newChar === originalChar) {
                    continue;
                }
                
                const nextWordArr = currentWord.split('');
                nextWordArr[i] = newChar;
                const nextWord = nextWordArr.join('');

                if (wordSet.has(nextWord) && !visited.has(nextWord)) {
                    visited.add(nextWord);
                    queue.push([nextWord, level + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return 0; // No transformation sequence found
};
```
